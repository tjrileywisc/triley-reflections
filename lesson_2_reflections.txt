What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Creating a repository only sets up the directory to be ready to accept submissions. If it's not done, the files are not in any kind of source control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area is one small step up from the working directory. It directly specifies what you're planning on adding to source control. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

- After making a change, immediately add the file to the staging area.
